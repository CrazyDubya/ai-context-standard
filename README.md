## The Problem

You spend time explaining the same project context to every AI coding assistant:

- "This is a React TypeScript project using Next.js..."
- "Follow these coding standards..."  
- "The architecture works like this..."
- "Don't touch the legacy auth code..."

Then you switch tools and start over. **There has to be a better way.**

## The Solution

AI Context Standard provides a simple `.aicontext` file format that any AI tool can understand:

```markdown
---
version: "1.0"
---

# My React App

## Overview
A React TypeScript project using Next.js 14 with App Router.

## Architecture  
- `/app` - Next.js pages and layouts
- `/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/lib` - Utilities and business logic

## Coding Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Always include TypeScript interfaces for props
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Context Hints
When working on authentication, reference `/lib/auth.ts` patterns.
```

Place `.aicontext` files anywhere in your project. AI tools merge them hierarchically, giving you precise control over context at every level.

## Quick Start

1. **Create** a `.aicontext` file in your project root
2. **Write** your project context in simple Markdown
3. **Use** with any compatible AI tool

### Example Structure

```
my-project/
├── .aicontext                 # Project-wide context
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── .aicontext        # Component-specific rules
│   └── api/
│       └── .aicontext        # API-specific guidelines
└── docs/
    └── .aicontext            # Documentation context
```

## Key Features

🧠 **Tool Agnostic** - Works with any AI coding assistant  
📝 **Human Readable** - Just Markdown with optional YAML frontmatter  
🏗️ **Hierarchical** - Context inherits and overrides naturally  
🎯 **File Specific** - Target rules to specific file types  
🔗 **Composable** - Share and extend contexts across projects  
⚡ **No Dependencies** - Simple files, no special tooling required  

## Real Examples

### Frontend Project
```markdown
---
version: "1.0"
applies_to: ["*.tsx", "*.ts"]
---

# E-commerce Frontend

## Tech Stack
React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query

## Component Patterns
- Use compound components for complex UI
- Colocate types with components
- Export both component and props interface

### `*.tsx` files
Always use `forwardRef` for components that might need refs.
```

### API Project  
```markdown
---
version: "1.0"
extends: ["../shared-backend.aicontext"]
---

# User Service API

## Architecture
Clean architecture with domain-driven design principles.

## Standards
- Validate all inputs with Zod
- Return consistent error responses
- Log all requests with correlation IDs

### `*.route.ts` files
Include rate limiting and auth middleware on all public endpoints.
```

## Specification

📋 **[Read the Full Specification](./SPEC.md)**

The specification covers:
- Complete file format definition
- Context hierarchy and inheritance rules  
- Implementation guidelines for tools
- Migration paths from existing formats

## Tool Support

### Current Support
- 🏗️ **Reference Implementation** - Basic parser and validator
- 🔧 **VS Code Extension** - Syntax highlighting and validation
- 🖥️ **CLI Tool** - `aicontext` command-line tool for dynamic command discovery

### CLI Tool

The included `aicontext` CLI tool allows LLMs and developers to easily access context from `.aicontext` files:

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
./install.sh

# List available commands (auto-discovered from your .aicontext files)
aicontext --list-commands

# Get architecture information
aicontext architecture
aicontext --architecture

# Get coding standards
aicontext coding-standards

# Get full context
aicontext full

# Target specific files
aicontext --file src/components/Button.tsx architecture

# Output in JSON for tool integration
aicontext --format json architecture
```

**Key Features:**
- 🔍 Auto-discovers commands from your `.aicontext` file sections
- ⚡ Supports both `--flag` and `flag` syntax
- 🏗️ Properly resolves hierarchical context
- 📄 Multiple output formats (text, JSON, YAML)
- 🎯 File-specific context resolution

See [CLI_README.md](./CLI_README.md) for complete documentation.

### Planned Support
For now, only for vCode-IDE 

- [vCode IDE on Github](https://github.com/vibe-stack/vcode)

## Migration

### From Cursor Rules
```bash
# Your existing .cursorrules content becomes the main content
# Add version frontmatter and organize into sections
mv .cursorrules .aicontext
# Edit to add frontmatter and structure
```

### From README-driven Context
Extract AI-relevant sections from your README into dedicated `.aicontext` files while keeping human documentation separate.

## Contributing

This is a community-driven standard. We need your input to make it work for everyone.

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from `.cursorrules`?**  
A: AI Context is tool-agnostic, hierarchical, and designed as an open standard. While Cursor Rules work great in Cursor, AI Context files should work everywhere.

**Q: What about existing project documentation?**  
A: AI Context complements your existing docs. Keep your README for humans, use `.aicontext` for AI tools.

**Q: How do I validate my `.aicontext` files?**  
A: Actively being worked on

**Q: Can I include sensitive information?**  
A: Be mindful of what you include. Context files may contain architectural details you don't want to share publicly.
